# The Watford Weather Society

The Watford Weather Society is an automated weather data capture, plot, and email project that I set up in memory of my grandfather Eric.

## Backstory

My grandfather had a true passion for the weather. From around the age of 20 (the same age I was when I created this project), until just a couple months before he passed, he would record the weather from his home in Waford. Yes, you read that right. Every single day without fail he would record the weather. He would do this using his own thermometer (temperature), barometer (pressure), and udometer (rainfall). At the end of each month, he would hand draw a plot of that month's weather.
