# The Watford Weather Society

The Watford Weather Society is an automated weather data capture, plot, and email project that I set up in memory of my grandfather Eric.

## Backstory

My grandfather Eric had a true passion for the weather. From around the age of 20 (the same age I was when I created this project), until just a couple months before he passed, he would record the weather every morning from his home in Watford. Yes, you read that right. Every single day without fail he would record the weather. He would do this using his own thermometer (temperature), barometer (pressure), and udometer (rainfall). At the end of each month, he would hand draw a plot of that month's weather.

## Where Do I Come Into This?

Eric always wanted someone to take over this project when he was unable to continue. What I lacked in his commitment to consistent manual weather recording, I had in a decent amount of programming knowledge at the time. So I decided to carry on the project with a modern twist, one that he'd never used himself but had always been fascinated by. I decided to capture, plot, and email the monthly weather report all automatically through code on my computer.

## Capturing the Data

The first step was to find a way to capture the data. To do this I used a weather API. I'd
