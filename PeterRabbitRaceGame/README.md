This is a project I undertook to find out who the best character was in the Peter Rabbit Race Game, a game created in 1917 by Beatrix Potter, that has a concept similar to snakes and ladders, but with four different characters all on their own paths.
I did this by simulating the 10,000,000 games of each character, counting their amount of turns, and comparing these to each other.

NOTE: This project is still currently underway, and so the code is messy and lacks comments in some areas. The plan for this project is to eventually incorporate it into a Communicating Maths module at university, where I will create a video around the background and analysis of this project.

Results:
Preliminary results suggest that Jeremy Fisher is a few moves slower than the other characters on average, with Peter Rabbit having a very slight lead overall.

## Histograms

These are the histograms for the number of rolls for each character, with 0.025, 0.5, and 0.975 quantiles:
